# CosmicRayDetector

To reduce manufacturing costs, one PCB was designed all modules. This PCB used in three variants:

- **A/D converter** - four pieces, each for each row of GM Tubes. Mount **only** components visible on  GMTubeConnector.sch, HVConnector.sch
- **Connector between GM tube and high voltage generator** - four pieces, each for ach row of GM Tubes. Mount **only** components visible on **only**  GMTubeConnector.sch, ADC.sch, PowerSupply.sch
- **User interface** - one piece. Mount **only** components visible onUserInterface.sch PowerSupply.sch

In total, nine PCBs are needed.
